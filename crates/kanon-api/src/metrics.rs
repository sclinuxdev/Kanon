//! Lock-free runtime metrics and Prometheus text exposition.
//!
//! Counters are plain atomics updated on the hot path with `Relaxed` ordering: the
//! management console requires monotonic, eventually consistent numbers, never a globally
//! synchronized snapshot, so paying for cross-thread fences on every message would be
//! wasted work. Gauges that describe live infrastructure (uptime, memory, session counts)
//! are sampled at scrape time from their authoritative owners instead of being mirrored here.
