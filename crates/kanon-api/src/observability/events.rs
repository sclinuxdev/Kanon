//! Message lifecycle trace bus backing `/ws/v1/events`.
//!
//! The bus is the single choke point through which every observable lifecycle transition
//! flows: the core pipeline publishes [`PipelineStage`] records through the
//! [`PipelineObserver`] implementation, while the LLM agent publishes reasoning and tool
//! calling stages through [`TraceAgentHook`](super::hooks::TraceAgentHook). Because both
//! feed one broadcast channel, the console can reconstruct a full timeline — ingest,
//! pre-filter, command match, tool calling, outbound delivery — from a single ordered stream.
