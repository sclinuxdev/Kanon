//! Platform adapter contract, built-in adapter registry, and the Fast-ACK ingest handle.
//!
//! # Why adapters exist
//! The microkernel is platform agnostic: it knows how to filter, route and reason, but it never
//! speaks any IM protocol. A **platform adapter** owns exactly one platform identifier (the same
//! string carried in `PipelineEventRequest.platform`) and is responsible for two directions:
//!
//! - **inbound**: pushing user messages into the core through [`EventIngress`], which preserves
//!   the Fast-ACK guarantee (non-blocking enqueue, explicit backpressure instead of blocking);
//! - **outbound**: turning a [`DeliverMessageRequest`] into an actual platform API call.
//!
//! # Two implementation routes, one contract
//! - **Built-in (in-process)**: a Rust type implementing [`PlatformAdapter`], registered on the
//!   [`AdapterRegistry`]. Zero IPC overhead, ideal for HTTP-facing bridges.
//! - **Plugin (out-of-process)**: a plugin whose static manifest declares an `[adapter]` platform.
//!   The supervisor discovers it from the manifest and routes outbound messages to the owning host
//!   through `MessagePipelineService.OnDeliverMessage`; inbound messages come back through
//!   `BotApiService.IngestEvent`. Both primitives already exist in the gRPC contract, so plugins
//!   need no core-side registration call.
//!
//! Adapters are resolved by platform on the outbound path only; the pipeline itself stays unaware
//! of which route served a message.
