//! Shared, hot-swappable handle to the node's agent runtime.
//!
//! # Why a slot instead of a plain `Arc<Agent>`
//! The model provider is no longer decided once at process start: the management console can
//! configure, replace or clear it on a running node. Every consumer of the provider — the
//! pipeline worker that answers chat messages, the management gateway that serves
//! `/api/v1/chat/completions`, and the IPC `RequestLLM` gateway used by plugin hosts — must
//! therefore read the *current* agent at call time instead of capturing one at construction.
//!
//! [`AgentSlot`] is that single point of truth. It is deliberately tiny: a read-mostly
//! `Option<Arc<Agent>>` behind a synchronous lock, so consumers pay one short lock acquisition
//! plus an `Arc` clone per call and never hold the lock across an `await`.
