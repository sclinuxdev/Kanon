class CoreHandle:
    """Adapter-facing handle for pushing inbound events into the Kanon Core pipeline.

    A handle wraps one *already connected* ``BotApiServiceStub``; it never dials,
    never re-dials and never closes a channel itself. Connection ownership stays
    with the plugin host, which keeps exactly one IPC endpoint and one lifecycle
    in the process.

    Why a single shared channel instead of dialing per call
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Adapters ingest at message rate, and every ``grpc.aio.insecure_channel``
    allocates a fresh HTTP/2 connection (file descriptor, connectivity task and
    handshake round trips) to ``core.sock``. Dialing per ``ingest_event`` call
    would multiply descriptors and latency for no benefit, and would leave
    orphaned channels behind whenever a task is cancelled mid-flight. Core
    exposes one endpoint and multiplexes concurrent streams over HTTP/2, so a
    single long-lived channel is both the cheapest and the intended topology;
    it also reconnects on its own after a Core restart, so adapters need no
    dialing or reconnection logic of their own.

    Because several adapter tasks (one poller per platform/chat) may share that
    channel, the handle serializes ingest calls behind an ``asyncio.Lock``:

    * ``accepted == False`` backpressure stays actionable - one call in flight at
      a time means a "queue full" answer is never masked by a concurrent burst;
    * events reach Core in the same order the adapter tasks scheduled them,
      which matters for per-channel conversational ordering;
    * the shared stub is never used concurrently with host shutdown, so closing
      the channel cannot race an in-flight RPC from another task.

    Fast-ACK and why ``IngestEventResponse.accepted`` matters
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Core never blocks on the pipeline: ``IngestEvent`` performs a non-blocking
    enqueue into a bounded queue and answers immediately. A response therefore
    means *"Core received your event"*, not *"Core processed your event"*. When
    the queue is full Core returns ``accepted=False`` and drops the event to
    protect the microkernel; adapters must inspect that flag (and may retry later
    at their own discretion). This handle deliberately returns the raw response
    instead of raising or retrying, so the caller owns that policy.

    Transport failures are *not* converted into a response: if Core is
    unreachable, the RPC raises ``grpc.aio.AioRpcError``. The SDK never
    fabricates ``accepted=True`` (or any synthetic response) for a call that did
    not reach Core.
