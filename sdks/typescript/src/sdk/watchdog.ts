/**
 * Core-liveness watchdog for the TypeScript plugin host.
 *
 * A plugin host is a child of the Core, but parentage is not a liveness guarantee: a Core
 * killed with `SIGKILL`, or whose parent terminal disappears, leaves its hosts running. Such
 * an orphan keeps serving its platform (a gateway socket, a long-poller) while nothing can
 * answer — and once a new Core starts, the orphan and the fresh host both serve the same
 * platform, so every inbound message is handled twice.
 *
 * The watchdog probes `BotApiService.Ping`. Any answer proves the Core is alive; after
 * `failuresBeforeStop` consecutive failures the host is stopped, which unloads the plugin and
 * closes its platform connections.
